Dragon Fairest:

This Snow White is no damsel in distress. He's a dragon shifter on the run from the foster mother who wants him dead.\
Jack has three unbreakable rules of survival:\
One, never reveal his full dragon form.\
Two, steer clear of magic users at all costs.\
Three, always trust his instinct for trouble.\
And there's no doubt a princess accused of cursing her own family is exactly the kind of trouble he should avoid. Despite Jack's intention to keep Kynara at arm's length though, her intriguing mix of vulnerability and stubborn determination draws him like no one else ever has.\
A fugitive from her own people, exhausted and alone for the first time in her life, Kyn is running out of options. Asking for aid from a band of shady treasure hunters is a risk, but she has nothing left to lose. To save her family and her kingdom, she'll take any help she can get. Even from handsome, irritating Jack who despises her magic yet throws himself into danger to defend her. With the evil Grey Enchantress tightening her grip on the kingdom of Ardell, Jack and Kyn may have to sacrifice everything to stop her.

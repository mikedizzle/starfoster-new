**T﻿raitor's Masque:**

She has one job—attend a masqued ball and dance with a handsome prince. What could possibly go wrong?

Everything, that’s what. After years of submitting to her stepmother’s unreasonable demands, Trystan finally has a chance to be free. The promise of a new life, in exchange for her help. Simple, right? After all, the old woman has only asked for one night.

One night, one beautiful gown, one dance… and one message to be delivered to a mysterious recipient. It should be easy. Maybe even fun.

Especially when she can slip away into the night after the dance, leaving no clue as to her identity. But before she can escape the ball, Trystan makes a shocking discovery that leaves all her hopes in ruins. She will be forced to confront two very different princes—and choose whether to betray her kingdom… or her heart. If she’s lucky, maybe she’ll even survive to tell about it later.

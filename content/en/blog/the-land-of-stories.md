Through the mysterious powers of a cherished book of stories, they leave their world behind and find themselves in a foreign land full of wonder and magic where they come face-to-face with fairy tale characters they grew up reading about.\

But after a series of encounters with witches, wolves, goblins, and trolls alike, getting back home is going to be harder than they thought.

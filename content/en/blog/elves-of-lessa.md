In a land where humans and elves find it difficult to communicate, Tari—an elf—is bound to Captain Arion—a human military officer—in a ceremony designed to promote friendship between the two races. When the ceremony is over the pair discover that the impossible has happened: they can understand each other in spite of the language barrier. Thrown into a storm of politics, Tari and Arion are put in danger by those who want humans and elves to remain separate. Can they beat the odds and save both their countries or will evil win?

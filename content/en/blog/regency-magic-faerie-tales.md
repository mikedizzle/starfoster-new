Her Fae Secret:

Eleanor Maybury and her sisters have spent the last five years secretly dancing in Faerie every Seventh Night. Now they've come to London for a debut Season in hopes of finding a good match. But the Faerie Queen's invitation will end as soon as they get engaged. Could Eleanor possibly fall deeply enough in love to choose marriage over their precious visits to Faerie?\
\
Due to the restoration of peace, James Weston has returned to England after seven years of service as a magician in the Royal Navy. He isn't looking for a wife; he's looking for a new career path. But he can't deny that Eleanor is everything he's ever wanted and more.\
\
Can their love survive her family's secret?

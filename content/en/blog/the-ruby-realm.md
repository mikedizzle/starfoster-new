**N﻿ote this book series takes place after the Emerald Realm some of the characters cross over but you can read Ruby Realm first if you want.** 

Crimson Claws:

Roisen Karro and her grandmother run the most beloved bakery in the province of Omaira. Ever since her father disappeared seven years ago, Ro has decided there is no place for a man in her heart, especially an obnoxiously flirty woodcutter. Unfortunately, her granny has no issue encouraging the young man’s advances toward her.\
At the far end of Omaira, a strange foreigner washes up on the shores and finds himself amongst the ranks of a nefarious group of beasts. With no knowledge of the Ruby Realm or even a grasp on their language, the foreigner agrees to do their dirty work until he gets back on his feet. All they asked him to do was kidnap some girl from a bakery, anyway...\
As Ro discovers there is more behind her father’s disappearance than she knew, she finds herself entangled in the schemes of a sly new foe. With only the clothes on her back and a pack of wolves on her heels, Ro must find her way back to her granny before it’s too late for them both. Will Ro be able to survive the hunt? Or will the beasts swallow her family whole...?

T﻿he Unlucky Prince by Deborah Grace White:

**A sacrifice to duty. Magic gone awry. And a prince with the worst luck on the continent.**

Prince Ari has always struggled to find his place in his own kingdom…maybe because he spent half his childhood trapped in a swan’s body. His mother thinks he should find a wife and settle down, but far from being subdued by his past brush with magic, he’s convinced life has more adventure for him yet. That belief takes him to the neighboring kingdom—their former enemies who are now their allies.

Princess Violet expects nothing from the foreign prince’s visit, except maybe a last chance for some lighthearted fun. After all, she still has a few days before carrying out her secret plan to sacrifice her heart for the sake of the kingdom. Prince Ari will be leaving soon, so where’s the harm in a bit of flirtation?

Except neither of them have any idea of the forces working against their plans, both from inside the castle and from within their own hearts. And that’s before Ari falls afoul of the worst luck imaginable. As it turns out, being cursed to be a frog is even worse than being a swan.

Ari’s apparent absence only clears the way for darker plots, but fortunately amphibians see things humans don’t. It will take both a determined princess and a more-than-usually resourceful frog to uncover what’s really going on before it’s too late—both for Violet’s heart and the future of the kingdom.

The Unlucky Prince, a retelling of The Frog Prince, is book 1 of Once Upon A Prince, a multi-author series of clean fairy tale retellings. Each standalone novella features a swoony prince and his flaws, growth, and happily ever after.

It’s set in the world of The Kingdom Tales, a completed series of six clean fairy tale retellings by Deborah Grace White. The Unlucky Prince takes place four years after the end of the series but can be enjoyed without any prior reading.

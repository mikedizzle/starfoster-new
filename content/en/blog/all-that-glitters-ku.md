**T﻿ainted Beauty:**

A dragon’s curse, a deadly touch, a maiden tainted by beauty… can they break the curse—or will it consume them?

Aurelius has lost everything. Desperate to regain his worth, he accepts a gift from a dragon, but it comes at a terrible price. Now, the beast within him is out of his control—and it’s too late to undo the damage he’s caused.

Then he meets her.

The most enchanting maiden he’s ever seen.

Melora is trapped in a life she never wanted, sold off to the highest bidder to pay her father’s debts. But, when his greed takes things too far, she sacrifices herself to save her sister from a monstrous dragon.

Swept away to the dragon’s gilded domain, Melora finds Aurelius. He is arrogant, proud, and infuriatingly persistent—but there’s a side to him that calls to her, that makes her feel valued in a way she’s never known before.

Captive in this glittering world, Melora is surrounded by secrets that threaten to destroy them. Why won’t he touch her? What lies behind the forbidden door?

As the days pass, their time is running out. Will they break the curse before it’s too late, or will the glint of gold taint everything?

Tainted Beauty is a reimagining of “Beauty and the Beast” intertwined with “King Midas.” Fly away with a dragon shifter in this thrilling and swoony fairytale romance, part of the All That Glitters series—a collection of twelve books brimming with Tales of Treasure and True Love. Each book is written by a different author and can be enjoyed in any order, so pick a new favorite and discover that not all that glitters is gold.

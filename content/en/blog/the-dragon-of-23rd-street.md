Dragon Chained:

A dragon, a fae, and a pixie walk into a bookstore…

\
Sounds like a joke, right? For me, it’s just an ordinary day on the job. At least, it has been ever since my aunt disappeared and left me with her store, her cat, and a whole lot of unanswered questions.\
My plan is to stay hidden. Pretend I’m human. Sell books, drink tea, and never ever talk about the dragon.\
But it turns out my aunt had secrets, and a lot of those secrets seem to involve me ending up dead. To survive, I’m going to have to learn how to fight, even if it means placing my trust in a total stranger.\
Draven is a half-fae assassin who’s as gorgeous as he is irritating, and his motives are less than clear. He might be willing to help me—for a price—but is it a price I’m willing to pay?\
And if I accept his help, can I trust an assassin to keep the biggest secret of them all?

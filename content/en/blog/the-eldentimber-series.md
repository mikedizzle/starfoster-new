**P﻿ippa of Lauramore:**

Thirty Knights. Five Events. One Determined Princess.\
\
In order to avoid a loveless arranged marriage to a man she cannot stand, eighteen-year-old Princess Pippa of Lauramore makes a bold move: she begs her father to hold a marriage tournament.\
\
Knights travel from far and wide for a chance to win the princess's hand, but she immediately sets her sights on one—Galinor of Glendon. He's strong. He's handsome. He's a girl's dream come true.\
\
But as the events progress, Pippa learns her valiant knight is prettier than he is capable. Left with no other choice, the princess enlists the help of the one man with the power to shatter the fragile balance of the tournament—a man she should keep at arm's length.\
\
A man who calls her like a moth to a flame.\
\
Pippa knows she plays a dangerous game, but when the stakes are this high, she's not sure if she can afford to walk away...

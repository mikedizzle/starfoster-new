**Married at Sunrise:**

He’s marrying her to get a kingdom. She doesn’t trust anyone. When feelings and pirates get between the two, can they work together to survive?

To become a king or queen of an Incandescent Kingdom is one of the utmost honors, and Prince Jax is sure he deserves it. He’s only got two dilemmas: He must be married, and he must tie up all loose ends from the Pirate Wars. That should be easy, especially since he went undercover as a pirate to end the wars. He’s good—too good—at playing different roles to get his way. But when his arranged marriage to Princess Heilani starts to change like the turn of a tide, he knows there’s more at risk than the masks he wears... Will Jax gain a kingdom without losing his heart?

Heilani always knew an arranged marriage was in her future, so rejecting suitors who ask for her hand gives her satisfaction... until the king of Sunrise forces her to marry none other than Fox, a treasure hunting captain. Avoiding the captain on a ship is impossible, but growing feelings for him seems inevitable. When Heilani learns his true intentions for her, she knew she should have never trusted him. He’s a former pirate, after all... but is it possible there’s more to him than she realizes? Can Heilani learn to forgive and trust again when high sea adventures force her to turn to the prince?

“Married at Sunrise” is a retelling of “King Thrushbeard” and is the first book in the Incandescent Kingdoms series. Each book can be read in order or as a standalone. This enemies to lovers, arranged marriage novel is a clean and swoony romance, perfect for young adult and adult readers!

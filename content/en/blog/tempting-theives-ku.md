# To Sway a Rogue:

The morally grey characters of Six of Crows combine with the storytelling of Once Upon a Time in this swoony romantic fantasy novella about thieves, undeath, and innkeeping.\
\
A thief queen, an undead rogue, and a vampiric assassin walk into an inn…\
\
A thousand years ago, Talyria was a queen of thieves. Robbed of everything by a nearly eternal sleep and a powerful necromancer who is still on the loose, she vows to reclaim what she once lost. But that’s easier said than done when faced with the crippling fear of that necromancer finding her again. Especially since a new crime lord seems to have taken her place as the ruler of the criminal underworld, and he won’t be giving up his power easily.\
\
Forced to lay low while she plots her revenge, Talyria finds an unwitting innkeeper’s son to marry her and pass her off as his brand-new bride. He has no idea of her secrets. But Victor has secrets of his own. Like that he’s actually a thief, and the fact that he isn’t fully alive anymore. Or that he’s now the host of the demigod of chaos.\
\
Corallin is the daughter of the famed crime lord Elwis the Eel and she is on the hunt for a spellbook. Her quest has brought her through a blizzard to the door of Talyria and Victor’s inn. Little does she know; she isn’t the only thief who is staying the night.\
\
Or the only killer.\
\
With a terrible snowstorm brewing outside, everyone finds themselves trapped in the inn until dawn. But as bodies begin piling up within Victor, Talyria, and Corallin realize that they aren’t the only ones harboring a secret.\
\
And one of those secrets is going to get them all killed.\
\
May the best thief survive.\
\

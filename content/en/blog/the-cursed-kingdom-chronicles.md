**T﻿rue Princess:**

Welcome to the ancient land of Terra, where curses run rampant throughout all the kingdoms and where the royalty desperately attempt to break their curses and claim their own happily ever afters.

Princess Elisianna wasn't gifted at birth. No, she was cursed. While her body may be weak and easy to bruise, what she did have was a strong intelligent mind. But a strong mind isn't easily seen, especially with a nickname like "Fragile Princess." Elise isn't sure she'll ever break her curse, for who could see past her weak frail body to who she truly is? Her curse, after all, can only be broken if someone falls in love with her strength and who would find her strong?

Prince Liam desperately needs to find the truest princess in the lands or else his entire kingdom will be cast into darkness and be lost forever. When the king and queen call for a tournament amongst the neighboring kingdoms to find a true princess for their son, Prince Liam is doubtful he will find a true princess to love. When he happens upon a bruised girl sleeping on the sofa in the castle and accuses her of trespassing, he doesn't realize she is one of the princesses there for the tourney. Her sharp tongue puts him in his place and while a bit stinging, he is drawn to her words and can not get them out of his head.

True princess is the first book in The Cursed Kingdom Chronicles, a series of clean stand-alone but connected, fairytale retellings. If you enjoy clean romance, adventure, and witty banter, The Cursed Kingdom Chronicles is for you!

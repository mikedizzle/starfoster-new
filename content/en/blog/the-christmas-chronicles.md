T﻿he Hidden Gift by Annette K. Larsen:



#### What if Father Christmas’s quest to help the downtrodden…started with his love for one girl?

In the quaint village of Tethurn, Annabelle has always been the steadfast pillar of her family, unafraid of hard work and sacrifice. But when her father falls gravely ill, her family's already tenuous situation becomes dire. Annabelle knows she cannot afford to lose her position as a maid, but a spiteful butler threatens her livelihood. Amidst the chaos, she finds an unexpected ally in Nicolai Closs, a gentleman whose kindness offers her a glimmer of hope and a cherished friendship.

Despite the expectations and obstacles that stand in their way, Annabelle dreams not only of saving her family but also of winning Nicolai's heart. But with food scarce and hope even scarcer, will Annabelle be expected to sacrifice more than she can bear so that her sisters don’t starve? And how can she be sure Nicolai’s attentions aren’t merely pity?

The Hidden Gift reimagines the origin of Father Christmas and St. Nick, where resilience, love, and the enduring strength of the human spirit light the path through the darkest of times, and the harsh realities of life are met with unwavering hope, kindness, and love.\

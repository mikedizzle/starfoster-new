**T﻿he Amethyst Star:**

A princess bonded. A breeder dismissed. A kingdom unraveling.\
\
When Princess Zara of Zephira is summoned to investigate vanishing oases and failing hatcheries, she expects a routine report—not a revelation. The dragons are faltering. The magic is thinning. And the Amethyst Star—the source of it all—may be dying.\
Titus, the brilliant Master of Dragon Breeding, has seen the signs. Rejected by the council and dismissed by the Dragon Master, he turns to Zara—the only one who listens, the only one who feels the wrongness in the wind.\
Together, they uncover a pattern of magical collapse and a truth buried beneath centuries of silence. But restoring the Star means defying the crown, risking their bond, and confronting a power that demands more than skill—it demands sacrifice.\
As trust deepens and danger rises, Zara and Titus must decide: will they save Zephira, or let it fall?\
\
A tale of elemental magic, dragon bonds, and the cost of being truly seen.\
\
This is the first book in the Jewel Realm

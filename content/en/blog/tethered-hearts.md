**T﻿ies of Legacy:**

A merchant girl with a life of freedom.\
A young man who just wants to settle down.\
A journey through three enchanted kingdoms.\
\
As a roving merchant—or peddler, as many call her—Avery lives a life of freedom that few ever experience. She can navigate the enchanted landscapes of six kingdoms, and she’s an expert at finding unique items and matching them with the right customer. If her traveling lifestyle means she doesn’t have any close friends, at least she can help communities in need. And it’s worth it not to be tied down. She might be alone, but that doesn’t mean she’s lonely.\
\
Elliot would love to be tied to his birth kingdom like most people. Such a restriction might be limiting, but it would be better than being bound to a candelabra—especially once that candelabra gets stolen. With his life on the line, Elliot has to find it—or whatever is left of it.\
\
The last thing Avery wants is a pesky stowaway on her cross-kingdom rescue mission—especially not one who claims he’s bound to one of the items in her cart. Elliot is equally unhappy to be trailing her through the kingdoms—he’s sick of traveling and ready to put down roots. But Avery has promised to help free him from the ties binding him, and he’s willing to make a final journey if it means being free of the candelabra. He’ll just have to make sure his heart doesn’t form its own tie with his beautiful traveling companion. Should be easy, right?\
\

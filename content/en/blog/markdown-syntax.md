## School for Good and Evil

### by Soman Chainani

Best friends Sophie and Agatha are about to discover where all the lost children go: the fabled School for Good and Evil, where ordinary boys and girls are trained to be fairy tale heroes and villains. 

As the most beautiful girl in Gavaldon. Sophie has dreamed of being kidnapped into the enchanted world her whole life. With her pink dresses, glass slippers, and her good deeds, she knows she'll get top marks at the School for Good and graduate as a storybook princess. 

Meanwhile, Agatha, with her black frocks, wicked cat, and the dislike of nearly everyone, seems a perfect student at the School for Evil. 

But when the two girls are swept into the Endless Woods, they find their fortunes reversed.
